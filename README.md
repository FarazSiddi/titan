# titan (v0.1.0)
Titan is a discord bot made by null#8672 on discord (null-2020 on GitHub)

This is my first ever python project that is uploaded to the GitHub repository, and will be one of the few projects that I will actively update.

Titan is intended to be a basic moderation bot with a few more interesting commands that will stand out, and is also showcased as a culmination
of my knowledge of the python syntax and its libraries.

More information will be added as time and more ideas will be implemented.

Thank you.

Updates:
- Revamped the source code of the bot

- Changed and improved the arrangement of files and folders for better code management.

- Added more commands such as t.bonk, t.warn, t.poll, t.starboard, and more.

- Added a serverwide leveling and ranking system.

- New and more refined custom help menu (will tweak it further in future updates).

- Added a log channel where moderators, administrators, and owners can check for member updates and events.

- Introduced a SQL storage system using sqlite3 with Python. This means commands such as t.rank, t.leaderboard, etc. will make use of this system.

- Instead of asyncio, the bot now uses apscheduler to set times for certain commands such as t.giveaway, t.poll, etc.

Expected Updates (v0.2?):

- Webscraping websites such as Urban Dictionary, Course pages and program calendars on the Ryerson website (if allowed), Reddit, and more. 

- Adding a math cog to allow users to calculate math problems through numpy, Pandas, seaborne?, and matplotlib.

- Adding new commands for the "fun" cog.

- Fixing and improving existing commands and bugs.
