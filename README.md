# Reap3r (v0.0.0)
Reap3r is a discord bot made by null#8672 on discord (null-2020 on GitHub)

This is my first ever python project that is uploaded to the GitHub repository, and will be one of the few projects that I will actively update.

Reap3r is intended to be a basic moderation bot with a few more interesting commands that will stand out, and is also showcased as a culmination
of my knowledge of the python syntax and libraries.

More information will be added as time and more ideas will be implemented.

Thank you.

Expected Updates (0.1.0?):

- Code Revamp. To create more complex and sophisticated commands, this program will require a package called "apscheduler", where 
certain segments of code can be triggered at a given time. To achieve this, a sqlite database will be installed which will need 
most of the code rewritten beforehand.

- A better customized r3!help command interface

- More organized files and folders for better management

- More commands and features such as r3!poll, starboard, r3!roleassign, r3!warn, r3!infractions, etc.
